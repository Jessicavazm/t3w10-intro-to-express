# t3w10-intro-to-express

Express.js is a fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js, designed to simplify building web applications and APIs. It provides an easy-to-use routing system, middleware support, and seamless integration with databases and templating engines. Express is widely used for creating RESTful APIs and full-stack applications, thanks to its flexibility and lightweight nature.
